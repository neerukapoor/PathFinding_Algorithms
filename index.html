                <h3>Graph traversal</h3>
                <p>Graph traversal means visiting every vertex
                    and edge exactly once in a well-defined order. While using certain graph algorithms,
                    you must ensure that each vertex of the graph is visited exactly once.
                    The order in which the vertices are visited are important and may depend upon the algorithm.
                </p>
                <h3>Breadth First Search (BFS)</h3>
                <p>
                    BFS is a graph search algorithm which find smallest path form source to goal vertex, where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) 
                    and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). 
                    You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes. Breadth First Search Algorithm finds smallest path.
                </p>
                <h3>Depth First Search (DFS)</h3>
                <p>
                    The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It
                     involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking. It does not guarantee shortest path.
                </p>
                <h3>Bidirectional BFSearch</h3>
                <p>
                    Bidirectional search is a graph search algorithm which find smallest path form source to goal vertex. 
                    It runs two simultaneous search – 
                    <p>
                    1.Forward search form source/initial vertex toward goal vertex<br>
                    2.Backward search form goal/target vertex toward source vertex
                    <br><br>Bidirectional search replaces single search graph(which is likely to grow exponentially) with two smaller sub graphs – 
                    one starting from initial vertex and other starting from goal vertex. The search terminates when two graphs intersect.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h3>Best First Search</h3>
                <p>
                    In BFS and DFS, when we are at a node, we can consider any of the adjacent as next node. 
                    So both BFS and DFS blindly explore paths without considering any cost function. The idea of Best First Search is 
                    to use an evaluation function to decide which adjacent is most promising and then explore. 
                    Best First Search falls under the category of Heuristic Search or Informed Search. It does not guarantee shortest path.
